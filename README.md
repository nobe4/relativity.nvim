move the cursor in space and time

Set a mark anywhere, at any time and travel back to it easily.

:warning: very early stage, expect nothing

# TODO

- Support auto-naming marks
- Look at `: mark-motions` and follow similar guidelines/auto-marks
- Add support for "last mark"
- `RLMark` shouldn't override but error if trying to
  create `RLMark!` to override
- `RLClear` clear a mark
- Require a filename to work
